			    </p><h2>XI.   DISCLAIMER AND NON-WAIVER OF RIGHTS</h2>
			    <p>Proalab makes no guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind as regards our mobile application and associated technology.

			    </p><p>The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement or course of performance, except as provided for under the laws of any province in Canada.

			    <h2>XII.   EXCLUSIONS</h2>
			    <p>As set out, above, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.</p>

			    <h2>XIII.   DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>

If a revision is material we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days’ notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
			    <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, in whole or in part, please stop using this mobile app.</p>
